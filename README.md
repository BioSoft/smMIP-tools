#smMIP-tools: a computational toolset for read processing and mutation detection from molecular-inversion-probes derived data#

Here we present an example of how to use smMIP-tools main two features.

The first is a read processing tool that performs quality control steps, generates read-smMIP linkages and retrieval of molecular tags.The second is an error-aware variant caller capable of detecting both single nucleotide variants and short insertion and deletions.

**Quick Start**

smMIP-tools are executed from the [terminal](http://www.test/). There is no need for installation. Just download the code files
